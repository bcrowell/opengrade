Make sure it still runs with all possible combinations of plugins installed and not installed.
Do this from a directory that's not the same as the directory the Spotter source is in, or else it will
find the plugins in that directory.
  make install_spotter_plugin
  make install_online_grades_plugin
  make deinstall_spotter_plugin
  make deinstall_online_grades_plugin
Change version number in:
  /home/bcrowell/Documents/web/source/ogr/ogr.source , and remake
  Makefile
  Version.pm
make test
make dist
make post
